Thought again how this would be a good idea.

A simple chaining system to chain together small webservices.

Put together a math webservice and chain together logic that uses it.

Come up with what the execution object looks like and figure out the file format later.

Call them nanoservices.
They already took microservices.

Webservices should have a login mechanism that retrieves a token.
