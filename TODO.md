## High Priority
- [ ] Get code for server loading definition and exposing service.
- [ ] Code for loading State defintion loading
- [ ] Code for State definition running.
- [ ] App for building State Machine using Canvas.

## Low Priority
- [ ] At some point rewrite the Cube rendering app so it is ES6 classes.

## Status

Dev proceeding on es6 for state machine.

However es6 site rewrite does not even load main.js...
Need to investigate how require and System.import work together and do we use another version of THREE.

## Old Tasks to be reviewed.

* Use these tutorials [http://www.johannes-raida.de/tutorials/three.js/]
[http://www.johannes-raida.de/tutorials/three.js/tutorial05/tutorial05.htm]

* Get express serving static site first.


* Get Renderer Online with entities abstracted.

* Get Mouse events to create entities

* Get Express Web Server instead of loading files from Disk.

* Figure out why isSame...function breaks THREE.

# Done

* Start Project

* Stabilized Base Modules.

* got Cube rotating.

* Integrated base.js with alterations to Object and Array.

* Iterate is a stable part of arrays.

* deep clone relegated to Utils singleton.

# Scenario

They need to scan a bar code so they call the barcode service.
The action has control over the parameters and headers sent to the webservice.
